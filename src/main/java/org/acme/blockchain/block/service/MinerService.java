/**
 * The core mining service responsible for coordinating the Proof-of-Work (PoW) process.

 * This Quarkus {@code @ApplicationScoped} bean uses the {@code @Scheduled} annotation
 * to periodically wake up and execute mining tasks for all active miners. It manages
 * the lifecycle of a miner (starting/stopping) and orchestrates the creation of new
 * blocks, including transaction inclusion, reward generation, and PoW nonce finding.
 * <p>
 * **Crucially, it uses the {@link MinerCacheService#getIsPulseMined} flag to enable all concurrent**
 * **mining threads to stop immediately upon a successful solve, preventing wasted work.**
 * <p>
 * It relies heavily on injected services for data fetching ({@link MinerCacheService}
 * and {@link TransactionCacheService}).
